   abstract = {Size is the first, and at times, the only dimension that leaps out at the mention of big data. This paper attempts to offer a broader definition of big data that captures its other unique and defining characteristics. The rapid evolution and adoption of big data by industry has leapfrogged the discourse to popular outlets, forcing the academic press to catch up. Academic journals in numerous disciplines, which will benefit from a relevant discussion of big data, have yet to cover the topic. This paper presents a consolidated description of big data by integrating definitions from practitioners and academics. The paper's primary focus is on the analytic methods used for big data. A particular distinguishing feature of this paper is its focus on analytics related to unstructured data, which constitute 95% of big data. This paper highlights the need to develop appropriate and efficient analytical methods to leverage massive volumes of heterogeneous data in unstructured text, audio, and video formats. This paper also reinforces the need to devise new tools for predictive analytics for structured big data. The statistical methods in practice were devised to infer from sample data. The heterogeneity, noise, and the massive size of structured big data calls for developing computationally efficient algorithms that may avoid big data pitfalls, such as spurious correlation.},

   abstract = {Most efforts to harness the power of big data for ecology and environmental sciences focus on data and metadata sharing, standardization, and accuracy. However, many scientists have not accepted the data deluge as an integral part of their research because the current scientific method is not scalable to large, complex datasets. Here, we explain how integrating a data-intensive, machine learning approach with a hypothesis-driven, mechanistic approach can lead to a novel knowledge, learning, analysis system (KLAS) for discovery and problem solving. Machine learning leads to more efficient, user-friendly analytics as the streams of data increase while hypothesis-driven decisions lead to the strategic design of experiments to fill knowledge gaps and to elucidate mechanisms. KLAS will transform ecology and environmental sciences by shortening the time lag between individual discoveries and leaps in knowledge by the scientific community, and will lead to paradigm shifts predicated on open access data and analytics in a machine learning environment.},

   volume = {1607.02165},
   abstract = {Professional societies and collaboratives have called for the incorporation of more quantitative skills, such as mathematical modeling, securely into the foundation and throughout undergraduate biology programs. However, the integration of modeling both within and between mathematics and biology curricula remains limited. One barrier to integration comes from differing perceptions about the nature of modeling, thereby limiting communication between disciplines. In this paper, we extend the "Rule of Five," initially used in calculus reform efforts, to build a modeling framework that explicitly separates and defines models as representations and modeling as a process. We discuss benefits to student learning and cross-disciplinary communication.},
